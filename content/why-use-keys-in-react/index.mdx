In React, the `key` attribute is used to identify which items have changed, been added, or 
removed from a list. Keys help React efficiently update and re-render components by maintaining 
the identity of each list item across updates. Without keys, React would have to re-render every item 
in the list, even if only one item changes, which can lead to performance issues.

## Efficient Updates and Rendering
React uses keys to identify which elements in a list have changed, been added, or removed. This enables React to optimize the rendering process by:

**1. Avoiding re-rendering unchanged items.**<br/>
**2. Ensuring that updates are applied to the correct elements.**

`Avoiding Index as Key`
Using an index as a key can lead to issues when the list changes, such as reordering or adding/removing items, because it 
may not uniquely identify the element's position.
