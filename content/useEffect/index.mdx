Until now, many developers have been using the useEffect hook in React without fully understanding how it works under the hood. By default, useEffect is a powerful and often necessary tool for side effects in functional components. This article aims to demystify the internal mechanics of useEffect and explain why it behaves the way it does.

We get lots of questions about it actually, with people regularly asking things like:

> Why does useEffect run after every render? How do I control when it runs? What about clean-up?

The useEffect hook is our attempt to provide a declarative API for managing side effects,
without the downsides of lifecycle methods.

Here's a simple example of how Suspense can be used with a data-fetching component:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
function ExampleComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Side-effect logic here
    console.log('Component rendered or updated');

    // Clean-up function (optional)
    return () => {
      console.log('Component will unmount or update');
    };
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means this runs once, similar to componentDidMount

  return <div>Hello, World!</div>;
}
export default ExampleComponent;
```

### What to Expect from Here On Out
What follows from here is a deep dive into the inner workings of useEffect. It includes every aspect you need to understand, like dependencies, clean-up functions, and even common pitfalls.

It's important to cover all of these use cases for a few reasons:

1. We want everything to be clear and understandable.

2. Really just the first reason, that's the whole point of the article.

3. Here's a third pretend reason, though a list with three items looks more realistic than a list with two items.

### Understanding Dependencies
The useEffect hook takes two arguments: a function containing the side effect logic and an 
optional array of dependencies. The dependency array determines when the effect should re-run.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Effect logic
}, [dependency1, dependency2]);
```

### Clean-Up Functions
One of the most powerful features of useEffect is its ability to clean up after itself. 
If your effect returns a function, React will run it when it's time to clean up, like when 
the component unmounts or before running the effect again.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const handleResize = () => {
    console.log('Window resized');
  };

  window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);

  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  };
}, []); // Empty array ensures this runs only on mount and unmount
```

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls

When using `useEffect`, it's important to be mindful of common pitfalls.
One common issue is failing to specify dependencies correctly, which can lead to 
unexpected behaviors or performance issues.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  };
  fetchData();
}, []); // Ensure the dependency array is correct to avoid infinite loops
```

### When to Use `useEffect`
Deciding when to use `useEffect` comes down to understanding its purpose: to handle side effects 
in functional components. This includes tasks like:

- **Fetching data from an API**
- **Subscribing to services or event listeners**
- **Directly interacting with the DOM**

### Code Example with Explanation
Let's look at a more complex example to understand how useEffect works in a real-world scenario:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
function DataFetchingComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    let isMounted = true;

    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
      const result = await response.json();
      if (isMounted) {
        setData(result);
      }
    };
    fetchData();
    return () => {
      isMounted = false;
    };
  }, []); // Dependency array ensures this runs once on mount

  if (!data) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }
  return <div>{JSON.stringify(data)}</div>;
}
export default DataFetchingComponent;
```
This example shows how to fetch data from an API while ensuring that we handle component 
unmounting correctly to avoid potential memory leaks.

### Conclusion
The `useEffect` hook is a fundamental part of React that allows functional components to handle side effects efficiently. Understanding how it works under the hood can help you avoid 
common pitfalls and write more robust React applications
